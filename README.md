# Machine Learning Algorithms Visualizer
This project serves as a learning tool for better understanding of the algorithms commonly used in machine learning.
The user can choose a specific algorithm and step through the computation while visualizing the whole process. The application provides a set of controlls
such as animation speed or single-step progress.
The user can also see the description of each step in the Progress window.
