This project serves as a learning tool for better understanding of the algorithms commonly used in the domains of machine learning and optimalization.
The user can choose a specific algorithm and step through the computation while visualizing the whole process. The application provides a set of features for controlling the visualization, such as animation speed, single-step progressing or options relevant to the specific algorithms. The user can also see a description of every step in the Progress window.

## Currently Supported Algorithms
- K-Means
- 🔒 Gaussian Mixture
- 🔒 Principal Component Analysis
- 🔒 Linear Discriminant Analysis 
- 🔒 Linear Regression
- 🔒 Logistic Regression
- 🔒 Support Vector Machine
- 🔒 Neural Network

#### Note on Implementation
The visualization shows a lot of information about the computation to make it as easy as possible to understand what the algorithms are doing. This means we cannot use vectorized or the "most efficient" implementation of these algorithms, as we need all the intermediate results at each step. Therefore, please do not take inspiration in the implementation itself.
However, we are planning to add a feature for displaying the implementation in different languages that could be used for real-world tasks.
